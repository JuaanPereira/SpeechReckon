# SpeechReckon
SpeechReckon - a tool that recognizes your voice and translates it into the language you wish.

- Developed using Python 3.6 + Tkinter with PyGubu GUI builder.
- Beta phase, program currently gets your microphone output and translates it into spanish, more languages will be added soon.

[IMPORTANT] In case you want to download this repository or just give a look at the code, keep in mind that you'll need the following libraries which were used in the development of the program:

    -> SpeechRecognition (https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
    -> Googletrans (https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/)
    -> PyGubu (https://pypi.org/project/pygubu/)
    
    
I might get bored one day and stop developing it, so if someone wants to continue it then coder galore.
